# Prompt Chain System

This directory contains a comprehensive chain-based prompt system for managing the complete software development lifecycle. The system is organized into specialized chains that work together while maintaining clear responsibilities and integration points.

## Core Chains

1. Project Requirements Chain

   - Requirements lifecycle management
   - Feature specifications
   - Requirements maintenance

2. Architecture & Design Chain

   - System architecture
   - Component diagrams
   - API design

3. UI/UX Chain

   - Wireframe generation
   - Layout design
   - UI styling

4. Code Quality Chain

   - Code evaluation
   - Code improvement
   - Quality validation

5. Testing Chain

   - Unit testing
   - Performance testing
   - Test validation

6. Backend Development Chain
   - Server implementation
   - Database operations
   - API endpoints

## Chain Integration

Each chain is designed to work both independently and as part of the larger development workflow:

1. Chains communicate through shared artifacts
2. Clear dependencies between chains
3. Consistent documentation standards
4. Regular validation points

## Usage Guidelines

1. Start with the index.md for:

   - Complete chain documentation
   - Command reference
   - Integration guidelines
   - Usage workflows

2. Each chain provides:

   - Clear purpose and components
   - Specific commands
   - Integration points
   - Success criteria

3. Components provide:
   - Specific functionality
   - Clear interfaces
   - Documentation
   - Integration guides

## Best Practices

1. Chain Usage

   - Follow documented workflows
   - Use proper commands
   - Validate results
   - Maintain documentation

2. Component Integration

   - Follow interfaces
   - Handle errors
   - Document changes
   - Test integration

3. System Evolution
   - Regular updates
   - Clear documentation
   - Proper testing
   - Version control

## Note

This system is designed to be:

- Modular yet integrated
- Clear yet comprehensive
- Flexible yet structured
- Independent yet collaborative
- Maintainable yet extensible

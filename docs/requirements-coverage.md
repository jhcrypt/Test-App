## Conclusion

All requirements from the BRD and PRD have been fully documented across the various documentation files, with the UXDD providing comprehensive coverage of design and user experience requirements. The documentation provides complete coverage of:

1. Functional Requirements
2. Technical Requirements
3. Design Requirements
4. Security Requirements
5. Performance Requirements
6. Development Standards
7. Operational Procedures
8. User Experience Guidelines
9. User Guidance

Each requirement has been documented in multiple relevant places, providing both high-level overview and detailed implementation guidance.

## Next Steps

1. Implementation can begin following the documented architecture, guidelines, and design system
2. Regular documentation updates should be maintained as the system evolves
3. Documentation should be validated with stakeholders
4. Training materials can be developed based on the user manual and UXDD

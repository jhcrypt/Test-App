#### Requirements:
1. **Core Functionality**:
- Transform user input text into visual outputs such as diagrams, infographics, and charts.
- Offer multiple visual options within 10â€“30 seconds.
- Ensure visuals are fully customizable and exportable in multiple formats (PNG, SVG, PDF).

2. **Frontend**:
- Framework: **Next.js** (React-based).
- Styling: **Shadcn-UI** and **Tailwind CSS** for responsive, accessible design.
- Features:
- Text input interface for user input.
- Visual editor with drag-and-drop functionality.
- Template library for quick designs.
- Export options for downloading visuals in preferred formats.
- Light/Dark mode and dynamic theming.

3. **Backend**:
- AI Processing:
- Utilize an API for AI-driven visual generation (mock with Python using TensorFlow/PyTorch during initial development).
- NLP for understanding and processing input text.
- Style transfer and image classification for generating visually appealing designs.
- Database: **PostgreSQL** for user and project data management.
- Services:
- Microservices for text analysis, image generation, and file storage.
- Authentication and user management via secure APIs.
- Real-time collaboration powered by WebSocket.

4. **Design**:
- Follow **Atomic Design System** principles to create reusable, modular components.
- Ensure a clean, intuitive UX/UI optimized for desktop and mobile.
- Provide customization options for visuals (colors, icons, fonts).
- Responsive and accessible layout with multi-language support.

5. **Collaboration & Sharing**:
- Enable real-time multi-user editing with WebSocket.
- Built-in commenting and feedback tools.
- Shareable links for generated visuals.

6. **Performance**:
- Visual generation time: <30 seconds.
- System response time: <2 seconds.
- Support for concurrent users with scalable backend infrastructure.

7. **Security**:
- End-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest.
- Secure file storage and GDPR compliance.
- Implement rate limiting and API authentication.

8. **Deployment**:
- CI/CD pipeline for streamlined development and production deployment.
- Containerization using Docker.
- Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for fast asset delivery.
- Monitoring, logging, and automated backups.

9. **Testing**:
- Unit, integration, performance, and cross-browser testing.
- Ensure seamless user experience across platforms.

### Deliverables:
1. **Full-Stack Application**:
- Source code for both frontend and backend.
- Detailed README for setup and deployment.
2. **Documentation**:
- API documentation for backend services.
- Design system guide for the UI.
3. **Testing Suite**:
- Automated tests for major features.
4. **Deployment Pipeline**:
- CI/CD configuration files.

Implement this system step by step, and prioritize a clean, maintainable codebase while ensuring scalability and security. Begin with a basic MVP and iteratively build upon it, incorporating user feedback.
